# Computer-website

One of my hobbies is to build custom PCs. I am developing a website to provide this service to others & in order to do that, I need to develop a database of components & their up-to-date prices

This web scraper works from geizhals.at, a popular price comparison website, updates my database (currently in an Excel sheet, to be transferred to mySQL) and will be shown on the front-end of my site

The next step is for me to build a widget that enables a front-end user to select from components to build out their ideal custom PC, with a final price being offered for all components
